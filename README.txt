== General Notes about this assignment ==

** Scalable Indexing **
One challenge of this homework is the indexing of the large corpus consisting more than 17,000 documents. A modified SPIMI was implemented, where there is a notion of 'blocks' or 'chunks'. Each chunk consists of 1000 documents. We index the documents chunk-by-chunk, storing the block dictionary and block postings as intermediate files, and finally merging them in the end.

After we have a scalable index mechanism, we can use the concurrent features in python3 to run indexing and merging concurrently. We indexed in the Tembusu cluster, which took around 40-50 minutes, which is a huge speedup from a single-threaded version, which uses around 2~3 hours.

** Query Expansion **
Query expansion and pseudo relevance feedback were used to expand the query to obtain more results. This is discussed in greater detail in BONUS.docx.

** Phrasal Query **
Two methods were considered and implemented for answering phrasal queries.
    i) N-gram index
    ii) Positional index
We started off with using N-gram index. However, we later found that the number of terms (i.e. unigrams, bigrams, trigrams) becomes too large, making the entire index files too large. To save space, positional index is used, where by the structure of postings are changed to (docID, [pos1, pos2, ...], tf-idf). Changing from N-gram index to positional index reduced the size of `dictionary.txt` from 1.2 GB to 7.5 MB and the size of `postings.txt` from more than 2 GB to roughly 1 GB.

In addition to the above, we also decided to make our our system's phrasal search more accommodating by appending the results of the phrasal search with the results obtained by treating the phrasal queries as free text queries.
For example, to answer a phrasal query of "fertility treatment", the top results would first be documents with "fertility treatment" as a phrase, followed by documents with "fertility" and/or "treatment".

** Ranked Phrasal Query **
Phrasal queries are ranked by first doing one round of boolean retrieval, and subsequently computing the cosine similarity of all discovered document to the query and subsequently sort them in non-increasing score.

** Law Report Citation **
Law report citations are unique for each case and lawyers often search for law reports using citations. As citations play such a central role in law report searching, the law report citations are extracted to facilitate searches.

** Court Hierarchy **
The corpus of this homework assignment consists of law reports from courts of the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and the US. Different courts have different levels of authority depending on the position of the court in the country's court hierarchy. A court with higher authority therefore has more influential reports, which can be factored into the way search results are ranked.

The court hierarchies for all the countries mentioned aboved were investigated online, and for court of each country, we assigned 'authority values' ranging between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest level of authority. These values are moderated across all countries such that the authority values of courts of different countries are comparable.
During search, the cosine similarity values for a document is multiplied by the 'authority value' of its corresponding court before sorting the search result.

However, during the evaluation phase, it was found that finding the right weights for the courts is non-trivial and due to time-constraints, we decided to turn off the influence of courts in the ranking of our results using a flag.

** Autocorrect (Experimental) **
During indexing, it was discovered that the documents in dataset.csv has many spelling errors, such as 'ludqment', 'distlnction', 'llkellhood', etc. This is probably due to OCR technologies when trying to convert pdf or images of law documents into csv. We attempted to use the `autocorrect` package to do the corrections. However, the experiment that attempts to correct each and every words in the corpus took more than 24 hours to index. Therefore, correcting spelling is impractical. We believe that the result will be more informed and more useful if we are able to correct spelling, or have a fuzzy searcher that also returns results that has spelling errors.
